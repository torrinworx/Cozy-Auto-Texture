# Cozy-Auto-Texture
A bridge between Blender and Stable Diffusion for the purposes of creating AI generated textures.

The purpose of this repository is to be the begining of a Blender add-on that automatically generates, upscales, and/or modifies 2D 1x1 image textures to be used in Blender or other 3D software. 

Stable Diffusion and the weights that are used (`stable-diffusion-v1-4`) are to large to store on GitHub effectively. For the purposes of this repository they are stored and retreived from this: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e77rFcVUlEH7G5RhQDwtGwdUOiG0EdJc?usp=sharing

This folder will automatically be downloaded into the directory Blender is installed, typically: `C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 3.2\3.2\scripts\addons\Cozy-Auto-Texture`

Steps to setup Stable Diffusion:
#1.
